# 1. Project Overview
This project analyzes ridership patterns on the Chicago Transit Authority's (CTA) elevated rail system, commonly known as the "L". Using SQL and Tableau, the project explores trends and insights to better understand how ridership has evolved and where service is most heavily used.

## Key Questions:
* How has ridership changed over time? Has it recovered to pre-COVID levels?
* Which lines are the most ADA accessible? 
- Measured by the number of ADA-accessible stations per line.
* Which lines and stations are the busiest? And the least busy?

## Tools Used:
* PostgreSQL: data cleaning and SQL queries
* Tableau: data visualization and dashboard creation
